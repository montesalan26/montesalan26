<h3 style="text-align:center;">Hi! I'm Alan Montes</h3>

I'm a data analyst with a background in logistics, supply-chain, warehouse fulfillment, and fuel delivery. Strong focus on problem-solving and data-driven decision-making with Python, SQL, and machine learning. My hands-on experience with real-world projects has equipped me with the ability to analyze complex datasets and derive actionable insights. One of my recent projects involved analyzing oil well data across various regions to identify the optimal location for new wells. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, I processed multiple datasets to calculate average profit margins and risk loss percentages. This analysis allowed me to pinpoint the region with the highest potential profitability while minimizing financial risks.

In my role as a fuel tanker driver, I developed exceptional problem-solving skills by navigating logistical challenges, optimizing delivery routes, and adhering to safety protocols. My attention to detail and ability to think analytically ensured accurate fuel deliveries, inventory management, and efficient scheduling. These experiences enhanced my ability to manage data-driven processes and make critical decisions under pressureâ€”qualities I am eager to apply in a data analyst role.

In addition to Python and Jupyter Notebook, I am proficient in SQL and Excel, which I have used to manage and analyze large datasets, driving efficiency and results. I am excited to bring my analytical mindset and diverse skill set to a dynamic team, helping businesses leverage data for smarter decisions and improved outcomes.
